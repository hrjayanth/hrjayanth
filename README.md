Welcome to my profile. I'm currently working at Oracle as a Principal Member of Technical Staff. I've previously worked on automotive Projects at Robert Bosch as a full stack developer using Java and Angular, and financial projects at Goldman Sachs and Citi Private Bank. 

I'm interested in Software Architecture, Algorithms and Data structures
